# hello-world
A Hello World example based on the standard GIT Tutorial. <br>
The Tutorial page can be found here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

I have been a member of Github since 2012, but have never used it.  Until now.

Note to remember:
  If working on HTML and you want to view it as a web page, use
  https://htmlpreview.github.io/
  
  and append the file you want to see with a '?', like:
  
  https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SCaruthers/hello-world/blob/master/Scents.html
